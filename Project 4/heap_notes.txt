For magic gadget:

look for execve in libc -> need to back up to where the environment pointers are setup and all arguments for bin/sh

OR look for /bin/sh in libc (do this)

for free hook 

how to find free_hook in gdb:    x/xg &__free_hook
find system:  x /i system (IOT call /bin/sh)

(perl -e `$|=1; <>; print "address 8 bytes";<>;print ' "/bin/sh\address 8 bytes"';<>;print "A"x56;' && cat) | nc addr port


RELRO: Relocations Read Only (GOT is read-only) and requires finding another place to overwrite (like free_hook)


PIE: position independent executable -- full randomization and binary will get loaded at different locations.  Separate from ASLR.  If ASLR is on, but PIE is off, it will load at the same location everytime


checksec.sh is a  protections script to show what protections are enabled on a file

Fastbin up to 160 bytes -- singly linked lists, all of same size (16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96...160)

Smallbins: 0xA0 -> 0x400 (1k) into 62 bins...consolidation before binning

tcache bins from 16 bytes -> 1k  but only takes 7 items in a tache list, and then it's full.  Anything beyond 8, and it's binned.

double frees into fastbin gets corruption (tcache is ok)
